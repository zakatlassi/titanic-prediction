# Titanic Survival Prediction App ðŸš¢

This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on several input features. The application is built using Streamlit and containerized with Docker.

## Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction App allows users to input data about a passenger and receive a prediction on whether that passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. The model was trained on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Features

- Predict survival based on passenger class, gender, age, fare, and port of embarkation.
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- Dockerized for easy deployment and consistent environment setup.
